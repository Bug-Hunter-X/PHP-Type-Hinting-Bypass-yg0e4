This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP related to type hinting.  The `foo` function is declared to accept two integers. However, it does not perform strict type checking, and PHP's loose type system allows implicit type conversions.  This means you can pass non-integer values like strings that can be cast to integers, leading to unexpected results and potential vulnerabilities. The bugSolution.php shows how to use strict type checking to prevent this.
